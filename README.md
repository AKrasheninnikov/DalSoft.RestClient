# DalSoft.RestClient

Inspired by Simple.Data and angular's $http service, DalSoft.RestClient is a very lightweight wrapper around System.Net.HttpClient that uses the dynamic features of .NET 4 to provide a fluent way of accessing RestFul resources. Originally created to remove the boilerplate code involved in creating integration tests andSDK's for RestFul API's. I know there are a couple of dynamic rest clients out there but I wanted the syntax to look a particular way, and I wanted it to be particularly useful for integration testing RestFul API's.
